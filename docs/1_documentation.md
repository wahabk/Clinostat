# OpenClino

It is very difficult to access a 3D clinostat, there are some companies that sell it but can be prohibitively expensive for gravity research. OpenClino can be built for Â£100 using off the shelf parts. OpenClino can run in continuous clinorotation or as a Random Positioning Machine (RPM).

This is a side project for me and is very much work in progress.

## Notation

TODO make a figure defining part names

which is x and y

## Code

### Usage

To run in clinorotation mode simply add these to your arduino's loop function, this will run the x axis at 30 rpm and the y axis at 60:

```cpp
void loop() {
    spin_continuous(30,60);
}
```

Or to run as a random positioning machine, this will run a random walk routine as specified in ESA's work:

```cpp
void loop() {
    RPM();
}
```

Don't forget to set the output pins for you motor controllers!

# Circuit design

This is a very simple arduino circuit with a button and 2 stepper motor controllers.
